# Artifacts Required for Any Agent Change

For each change, Agent must create:
- change_summary.md (what changed, why)
- tests/ (unit tests demonstrating behavior)
- citations.json (array of {claim, url, date})
- verification_commands.sh (commands to verify locally)
- preview_screenshot.png or storybook story
- confidence: number between 0.0 and 1.0
