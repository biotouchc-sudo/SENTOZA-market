# Silence Rules (When NOT to use AI)

## 🎯 Purpose
> Defines the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence.
> **Rule**: Human judgment overrides AI calculation in specific emotional/moral domains.

## 🚫 The "Absolute Silence" Zones
> In these areas, AI should provide options/data but **NEVER make the final decision**.

### 1. Brand "Soul" & Identity
*   **Context**: Defining the core "Vibe", "Mission", or "Visual Signature".
*   **Why**: AI averages existing data. "Soul" comes from unique deviation, not average.
*   **Role**: AI suggests 10 options; Human curates/mixes.

### 2. Crisis Communication
*   **Context**: Apologizing for a major service outage or data breach.
*   **Why**: AI lacks genuine empathy. "Perfect" corporate apologies sound robotic and offensive.
*   **Role**: Human writes from the heart; AI checks for grammar/clarity only.

### 3. Ethical Trade-offs
*   **Context**: "Should we sell user data to survive?" "Should we block this user?"
*   **Why**: These are moral choices, not optimization problems.
*   **Role**: AI provides risk analysis; Human takes moral responsibility.

### 4. High-Stakes Legal/Medical Advice
*   **Context**: TOS generation, Privacy Policy specific clauses, Diagnosis.
*   **Why**: Liability. Hallucination risk is non-zero.
*   **Role**: AI templates; Lawyer verifies.

## ⚠️ The "Intervention" Thresholds
> When Human MUST take over the keyboard.

1.  **Complexity Spiral**: If AI fails to solve a bug 3 times in a row → **STOP**. The approach is wrong. Reset prompt or code manually.
2.  **Tone Deafness**: If AI content feels "Cheesy", "Salesy", or "Generic" → **STOP**. Inject Human nuance.
3.  **Security Critical**: If writing Auth logic or Encryption → **STOP**. Verify every line manually.

## 🧠 The Human Override Protocol
If `Human` disagrees with `AI Recommended Best Practice`:
1.  **Acknowledge**: "AI suggests X for efficiency."
2.  **Override**: "Human chooses Y for [Brand/Experience/Gut] reasons."
3.  **Record**: Log the decision in `decision.ledger.md`.

> **"AI is the engine. You are the steering wheel. Never let go."**
