## 🧠 Cognitive Budgets

### 1. The "7 ± 2" Rule
*   **Constraint**: No menu/list should have > 7 items without grouping.
*   **Why**: Working memory limit.

### 2. The Decision Fatigue Cap
*   **Constraint**: Max 3 primary calls-to-action per view.
*   **Constraint**: Max 5 form fields per step in a wizard.

## 📉 Attention Decay Model

### The "F-Pattern" Scanner
*   **Design**: Critical info MUST be Top-Left.
*   **Design**: Headers must convey the summary (Users don't read body text).

### The "3-Second" Test
*   User must understand:
    1.  What is this?
    2.  Why do I care?
    3.  What do I do?
    *   ...in under 3 seconds.

## 🤖 AI Intervention Thresholds
> When should AI help vs stay quiet?

1.  **High Load**: User fills complex form → AI offers "Auto-fill".
2.  **Low Load**: User browsing gallery → AI stays silent (Don't bug).
3.  **Frustration**: User clicks "Back" twice → AI offers "Search/Help".
