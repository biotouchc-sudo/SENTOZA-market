# UX Decision Map (User State & Psychology)

> [!TIP]
> We do not design screens. We design **Decision Journeys**.
> This map tracks the user's emotional state and next logical step.

| User State | Emotional Context | Primary Decision Needed | UX Response (The "Vibe") | Next Success Step |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Landing (Guest)** | Curious, Skeptical, Exploring | "Is this place premium enough for me?" | **Awe & Trust**. High-res visuals, gold accents, slow motion. | Click "Services" or "VIP" |
| **Browsing Services** | Analytical, Comparing | "Do they have what I need?" | **Clarity & Logic**. Clean grid, clear prices, duration visible. | Select Service -> "Book" |
| **Booking Flow** | Focused, Committed | "Is this slot available?" | **Efficiency & Speed**. Zero friction, instant feedback. | Complete Payment/Booking |
| **Booking Confirmed** | Relieved, Anticipating | "What do I do next?" | **Reassurance**. Map location, Add to Calendar, WhatsApp link. | Close tab or Browse Gallery |
| **VIP Landing** | Ego-driven, Exclusive | "Am I special?" | **Exclusivity**. Darker theme, subtle animations, "Crown" imagery. | Join VIP Program |
| **404 / Error** | Frustrated, Lost | "How do I get back?" | **Helpfulness**. "Oops, let's get you a haircut instead." | Back to Home |

## Critical UX Laws Applied
1.  **Doherty Threshold**: Feedback < 400ms to keep user engaged.
2.  **Hick's Law**: Minimize choices in Booking Flow to increase conversion.
3.  **Peak-End Rule**: Ensure the "Booking Confirmed" screen is the most delightful moment.
